He misses dinner dates. He forgets to give presents.\\nAnd so, like many others in Silicon Valley, the 27-year-old has started a business: BetterBoyfriend.me, a service that sends girlfriends and wives a present every month for about $70.\\nSullivan is testing the service and has about 350 boyfriends as his clients. Most clients, he says, are his friends from university and other friends who are founders of start-ups or work for companies like Apple, Google and Facebook. The girlfriends of these men get presents from Sullivan.\\nEach month, Sullivan's clients choose from a list of seven possible gifts (chocolate, tea sets, etc). Then, Sullivan sends the gift to the boyfriend.\\nFor Sullivan, the surprise was the real relationships that he has formed with his clients. Sullivan says he has begun to see himself as a sort of relationship consultant for the boyfriends.\\nSullivan says he's made mistakes. In the beginning, the gifts he sent included receipts with his name on, Dan Sullivan. \\\"One of the boyfriends wrote to me and said, 'She's not mad but Cynthia found out'.\\\"\\nOf all the women BetterBoyfriend.me deliver packages to, about 50% know that Sullivan chooses the presents they receive: \\\"It's connected with age. I think, after you've been married for a longer time, you don't keep many secrets.\\\"\\nAnd over the year, the young founder says he's got to know the boyfriends really well. They've even sent a package to a hospital delivery room. The key, he said, is to remember that his relationship is with the boyfriend.\\nWhen he first started his company, he attached tags that said BetterBoyfriend.me to flower bouquets and went to the Mission District in San Francisco.\\n\\\"I looked for couples and gave the flowers to the girl but the boyfriends didn't like that. Not at all, \\\" he said. \\\"So I changed my idea and gave the flowers to the boyfriends.\\\"\\nnan\\nnan\\nnan\\nnan\",\n          \"Cathal Redmond was swimming off the Greek coast. He took some photos of colourful sh with his rst underwater camera and he was sure they would be great. But, when he looked at the photos later, they were brown and murky. The photos were bad because he was holding his breath underwater so he didn't have enough time to take the pictures. He thought that all he needed was a little more time to photograph the sh in their natural environment.\\nTo help with this problem, he has invented the Express Dive. It is a re llable air storage device, which you hold in your mouth. It lets you swim underwater for two minutes. It is somewhere between snorkelling, which is very limited, and scuba diving, which gives people the freedom to breathe underwater but needs heavy and expensive gear. The prototype of his invention looks like a combination of a scuba mouthpiece and a water bottle.\\n\\\"I wanted to let people to do more - not just get underwater and spend 30 seconds holding their breath, \\\" says Redmond, 27. In 2006, the Irish designer completed a scuba-diving course and loved the feeling of being able to breathe underwater and watch sh in their natural environment. But all the equipment he needed was less enjoyable.\\n\\\"I didn't like that I had about 50kg of equipment on me. And getting into the water was quite strange when you are used to trying to stay at the surface. It was a very surreal experience, \\\" he says. \\\"The real problem is that scuba diving limits what you can do. It allows you to stay underwater for longer but it takes a lot of planning. You have 20kg to 50kg of gear with you - you can't just walk on the beach and decide you want to go in.

When above the surface, the device takes in air through a vent in the mouthpiece. The air is compressed and stored in a tank, which has a light that ashes green when it is full. When it has nished taking in air, the vent closes and, when the person dives, air is fed back through the mouthpiece. The light turns from green to red when the air starts to runs out. The device can take in enough air for two minutes of diving and takes approximately the same amount of time to re ll.\\nRedmond says the mouthpiece feels similar to a snorkel. They have tested the prototype in parts. Redmond says he has shown that the motor can compress two minutes of air into the device and that a person can hold the device in their mouth.\\nWhat he has not yet done is test the device on a diver, completely underwater for two minutes. But, with enough testing, Redmond is sure the device will work well and that it will not be dangerous for swimmers underwater. The device will probably cost GBP280, he says, and it will probably weigh from 1kg to 3kg.\\nPerhaps some people think two minutes of air is not enough and is not much better than snorkelling. But, Redmond says two minutes can make all the difference underwater.

They put memories in the brains of mice by changing individual neurons.\\nIn the experiment, Tonagawa's team put the mice in a box and allowed them to explore it. As they explored it, their brain cells created a memory. The next day, they put the same mice in a second box and gave them a small electric shock. This scared the mice. At the same time, the researchers shone light into the mouse brains to bring back their memories of the first box. That way, the mice associated fear of the electric shock with the memory of the first box.\\nIn the final part of the experiment, the team put the mice back in the first box. The mice froze because they were scared. However, they had not received the shock in the first box and had no reason to be afraid.\\nA similar thing may happen when powerful false memories are created in humans. \\\"Humans are very imaginative animals, \\\" said Tonagawa. \\\"So, just like our mouse, it is quite possible we can associate what we have in our mind with bad or good events.

He said that the results of the experiments were an important first step in understanding false memories.

They say that the world's population may have to change almost completely to a vegetarian diet by 2050 to avoid catastrophic shortages.\\nHumans get about 20% of their protein from animal-based products now. However, this may need to decrease to just 5% to feed the extra two billion people expected to be alive by 2050, according to research by some of the world's top water scientists.\\n\\\"There will not be enough water to produce food for the expected nine-billion population in 2050 if we follow current trends and changes towards diets common in western nations, \\\" the report by Malik Falkenmark and colleagues at the Stockholm International Water Institute (\\u00a7\\u00a7PROT0\\u00a7\\u00a7) said.\\n\\\"There will be just enough water if the proportion of animal-based foods is limited to 5% of total calories.\\\"\\nWarnings that water scarcity could limit food production come at the same time as Oxfam and the \\u00a7\\u00a7PROT0\\u00a7\\u00a7 prepare for a possible second global food crisis in five years. Prices for items such as corn and wheat have risen nearly 50% on international markets since June. The price increase has been caused by severe droughts in the \\u00a7\\u00a7PROT1\\u00a7\\u00a7 and Russia, and weak monsoon rains in Asia. More than 18 million people are already facing serious food shortages across the Sahel.\\nOxfam says that the price increase will have a devastating effect in developing countries that rely heavily on food imports, including parts of Latin America, North Africa and the Middle East. Food shortages in 2008 led to fighting and riots in 28 countries.\\nChanging to a vegetarian diet is one way to increase the amount of water available to grow more food in a world where the climate is becoming increasingly erratic, the scientists said. Animal protein-rich food uses five to ten times more water than a vegetarian diet. One third of the world's arable land is used to grow crops to feed animals. Other options to feed people include stopping waste and increasing trade between countries that have a food surplus and countries that don't have enough food.\\n\\\"Nine hundred million people already go hungry and two billion people are malnourished although per-capita food production continues to increase, \\\" they said. \\\"Seventy per cent of all water is used in agriculture, and growing more food to feed an extra two billion people by 2050 will place greater pressure on water and land.\\\"\\nThe report is being released at the start of the annual world water conference in Stockholm, Sweden, where 2, 500 politicians, \\u00a7\\u00a7PROT0\\u00a7\\u00a7 groups, non-governmental groups and researchers from 120 countries meet to discuss global water supply problems.\\nCompetition for water between food production and other uses will increase pressure on essential resources, the scientists said. \\\"The \\u00a7\\u00a7PROT0\\u00a7\\u00a7 predicts that we must increase food production by 70% by mid-century. This will put additional pressure on our water resources, which are already stressed, at a time when we also need more water to satisfy global energy demand and to create electricity for the 1.3 billion people who are without it, \\\" said the report.\\nOvereating, malnourishment and waste are all increasing. \\\"We will need a new recipe to feed the world in the future, \\\" said the report's editor, Anders J\\u00e4gerskog.\\nnan\\nnan\\nnan\\nnan\",\n          \"<TO_ELEM> The Duchess of Cambridge gave birth to a son on Monday, 22 July. Third in line to the throne, the baby is destined to be the 43rd monarch since William the Conqueror obtained the English crown in 1066.\\nKensington Palace announced at 8.30pm that the baby was born at 4.24pm in the exclusive Lindo Wing at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, West London. \\\"We could not be happier, \\\" the Duke of Cambridge said.\\nIn a statement, Kensington Palace said: \\\"Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cambridge was safely delivered of a son at 4.24pm. The baby weighs 8lbs 6oz. The Duke of Cambridge was present for the birth.\\\" The duchess experienced at least ten and a half hours' labour, which Kensington Palace said had \\\"progressed as normal\\\".\\nThe Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Harry and members of both families were informed and were delighted with the news that Her Royal Highness and her child were both doing well.\\nIt is understood that the couple delayed making the announcement immediately so that they could enjoy some private time with their newborn. William telephoned his family to tell them the good news, speaking to the Queen, his father, Charles and younger brother, Prince Harry.\\nThe birth of the baby prince means the monarchy has three generations of heirs to the throne for the first time since 1894.\\nThe baby is the first Prince of Cambridge to be born for more than 190 years since Prince George of Cambridge, a grandson of George \\u00a7\\u00a7PROT0\\u00a7\\u00a7 and the only son of Prince Adolphus Frederick, the 1st Duke of Cambridge.\\nIn a statement, Prince Charles said: \\\"Both my wife and I are overjoyed at the arrival of my first grandchild. It is an incredibly special moment for William and Catherine and we are so thrilled for them on the birth of their baby boy.\\\"\\n\\\"Grandparenthood is a unique moment in anyone's life, as countless kind people have told me in recent months, so I am enormously proud and happy to be a grandfather for the first time and we are eagerly looking forward to seeing the baby in the near future.\\\"\\nThe newest royal will be called \\u00a7\\u00a7PROT0\\u00a7\\u00a7 Prince George* of Cambridge. When Kate was three months pregnant, a decree issued by the Queen said: \\\"All the children of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales should have and enjoy the style, title and attribute of Royal Highness with the titular dignity of Prince or Princess prefixed to their Christian names or with such other titles of honour.\\\"\\nFollowing tradition, a formal notice was posted on an ornate rococo-style easel - the same used to announce Prince William's birth in 1982 - in the forecourt of Buckingham Palace shortly before 9pm. Within an hour, the numbers had swelled from hundreds to thousands outside the palace, with locals and tourists alike keen to share in the historic moment.\\nNew Yorker, Sharon Surloff, was delighted with her phone picture of the royal bulletin, snapped after she and her niece and mother had squeezed through crowds to take a photograph of the easel.\\n\\\"The police were just saying to everyone: '\\u00a7\\u00a7PROT0\\u00a7\\u00a7, 20 seconds and then the next person'. It's just great to be here, though. We arrived this morning, at nine in the morning, so it has all worked out beautifully.\\\"\\nThe palace announced the birth in a press release. Minutes later, as crowds of wellwishers outside cheered, \\\"It's a boy\\\", the formal medical bulletin was taken from the hospital to a waiting car by Ed Perkins, Prince William's press secretary. He handed it to a soldier, who then took the notice, which was signed by Marcus Setchell, the Queen's gynaecologist, to Buckingham Palace under police escort.\\nThe prime minister was one of the first to offer his congratulations. Speaking outside 10 Downing Street, David Cameron said: \\\"It is wonderful news from St Mary's, Paddington, and I am sure that, right across the country, and, indeed, right across the Commonwealth, people will be celebrating and wishing the royal couple well.\\\"\\n\\\"It is an important moment in the life of our nation but, I suppose, above all, it is a wonderful moment for a warm and loving couple who have got a brand new baby boy. It has been a remarkable few years for our royal family: a royal wedding that captured people's hearts, that extraordinary and magnificent jubilee and now this royal birth - all from a family that has given this nation so much incredible service.\\\"\\nCongratulations came from the White House, too, from Barack Obama and his wife. The president said: \\\"Michelle and I are so pleased to congratulate the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on the joyous occasion of the birth of their first child. We wish them all the happiness and blessings parenthood brings.\\\"\\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, tweeted: \\\"Delighted for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. May God bless them all with love, health and happiness.\\\"\\nThe Labour leader, Ed Miliband, said: \\\"Many congratulations to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. I wish them and their son all happiness and good health.\\\"\\nThe campaign group, Republic, which launched its Born Equal initiative calling for every child to be born equal in political status and rights, said the royal birth raised questions about Britain and democratic values. Chief Executive Graham Smith said the baby should be able to grow up without \\\"constant interference and intrusion\\\". He said: \\\"Here is a new baby whose career, religion, even personal relationships have already been mapped out. Meanwhile, this is an opportunity for the rest of us to consider whether this circus is the best way to run things.\\\"\",\n          \"<TO_ELEM> When two people from the Marshall Islands saw a small fibreglass boat washed up on the beach of a remote Pacific island, they decided to take a closer look. Inside the boat, they found an emaciated man with long hair and a beard, who said he had been drifting for 16 months after setting out from Mexico, more than 12, 500km away.\\nThe man, dressed only in a pair of underpants, told his rescuers that he had been adrift in the 7.3-metre fibreglass boat, whose engines were missing their propellers, since he left Mexico for El Salvador in September 2012. A companion had died at sea several months before, he said.\\n\\\"His condition isn't good, but he's getting better, \\\" said Ola Fjeldstad, a Norwegian anthropology student doing research on Ebon Island, one of the Marshall Islands. The man said his name was Jos\\u00e9 Ivan and that he survived by catching turtles and birds with his bare hands. There was no fishing equipment on the boat, but a turtle was inside when it washed up. \\\"The boat looks like it has been in the water for a long time, \\\" Fjeldstad told reporters.\\nAccording to Fjeldstad, the islanders who found the man took him to a nearby island - which is so remote it has only one phone line and no internet - to meet the mayor, Ione de Brum. The mayor contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Majuro, the Marshall Islands capital. Officials at the ministry said that they were waiting for more details and expected the man to be taken to the capital.\\nOfficials are considering sending a boat to pick up the castaway. \\\"He's staying at the local council house and a family is feeding him, \\\" said Fjeldstad, who added that the man had a basic health check and was found to have low blood pressure, but did not appear to have any life-threatening conditions and was able to walk. \\\"We've been giving him a lot of water and he's gaining strength.\\\"\\nFraser Christian, who teaches maritime survival courses, said the man's story, if true, would be remarkable but not unique. It was possible to catch turtles or small fish by hand, he said, since \\\"they are inquisitive and they will approach a small boat to shelter underneath it\\\". Christian advises people who are forced to eat turtles to start with their eyes - \\\"lots of fluid\\\" - then move on to the blood.\\nThe major dangers castaways experience are exposure and dehydration. \\\"The basic rule is: no water, no food. You need water to digest protein. If you have no fresh water and it doesn't rain for a few days, so you can't collect rainwater, you have basically had it.\\\" Individual physiology was also important, with some people more able to survive than others.\\nStories of survival in the vast Pacific Ocean are not uncommon. In 2006, three Mexicans made international headlines when they were discovered drifting, also in a small fibreglass boat near the Marshall Islands. They said they had survived for nine months at sea on a diet of rainwater, raw fish and seabirds. But Cliff Downing, who teaches sea survival to sailors, said he was sceptical about the latest tale. \\\"It just doesn't sound right to me. There are 1, 001 hazards that would make his survival for so long very unlikely. \\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 342,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"According to a recent scienti c study, organic food has more healthy antioxidants than regular food. It also has fewer toxic metals and pesticides. The international team that did the study suggests that changing to organic fruit and vegetables could be as healthy as adding one or two portions of the recommended ' ve a day' fruit and vegetables.\\nThe team, led by Professor Carlo Leifert, concludes that there are big differences between organic and non-organic food. Organic food has between 19% and 69% more antioxidants. It is the rst study to show clear differences between organic and regular fruits, vegetables and cereals.\\nThe researchers say that the higher levels of antioxidants have the same effect as \\\"one to two of the ve portions of fruits and vegetables that people should eat every day\\\". They say this means that organic food is better for our health.\\nThe ndings will make people argue even more about whether or not organic food is better for people. Tom Sanders, a professor of nutrition at King's College London, said the research showed some differences. \\\"But are the differences relevant? I am not sure.\\\" He also said that research showed organic cereals have less protein than regular crops.\\nThe results of the research are based on an analysis of 343 studies from around the world - more than ever before - which examine differences between organic and regular fruit, vegetables and cereals. Helen Browning, who supports organic farming, said that the research showed that how we farm affects the quality of the food we eat.\\nLeifert and his colleagues conclude that many antioxidants reduce the risk of serious diseases, including diseases of the heart and certain cancers. The researchers also found much higher levels of cadmium, a toxic metal, in regular crops. They found four times more pesticides on regular crops than on organic food.\\nPeople will criticize the research: including so many studies in the analysis could make the results unreliable. Also, the higher levels of cadmium and pesticides in regular food are still below recommended limits. But, the researchers say that cadmium stays in the body and that some people may want to avoid this. They also say that recommended limits are for single pesticides and not for the mixture of chemicals that farmers use on regular crops.\\nAnother criticism of the research is that the differences it found may be the result of different climates, different types of soil and different types of crops; they may not be the result of organic farming. But, the biggest criticism will be about possible health bene ts. The most recent major analysis, which included 223 studies in 2012, found little evidence of health bene ts. \\\"Other studies did not and evidence that organic foods are much more nutritious than regular foods, \\\" it found.\\nSanders agrees. \\\"You are not going to be healthier if you eat organic food, \\\" he said. \\\"What is most important is what you eat, not whether it's organic or regular. It's whether you eat fruit and vegetables at all.\\\"\\nShoppers say that healthy eating (55%) and avoiding chemicals (53%) are the main reasons they buy organic food. Browning said: \\\"This research supports what people think about organic food. In other countries, there is much more support and acceptance of the bene ts of organic food and farming. We hope that now the \\u00a7\\u00a7PROT0\\u00a7\\u00a7 will accept organic food like people in the rest of Europe.\\\"\\nnan\",\n          \"Scientists have taken \\u00a7\\u00a7PROT0\\u00a7\\u00a7 from the tooth of a European hunter-gatherer and have found out what modern humans looked like before they started farming. The Mesolithic man, who lived in Spain about 7, 000 years ago, had an unusual mix of blue eyes, black or brown hair and dark skin.\\nHe was probably lactose intolerant and could not digest starchy foods easily.\\nThe invention of farming brought humans and animals much closer and humans probably developed stronger immune systems to fight infections from the animals. But the change to humans' immue systems may not be as big as scientists thought - tests on the hunter-gatherer's \\u00a7\\u00a7PROT0\\u00a7\\u00a7 found that he already had genes that made his immune system strong. Some of these genes still exist in modern Europeans today.\\n\\\"Before we started this work, I had some ideas of what we were going to find, \\\" said Carles Lalueza-Fox, who led the study at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona. \\\"Most of those ideas turned out to be completely wrong.\\\"\\nThe Spanish team started their work after a group of cave explorers found two skeletons in a deep cave high up in the Cantabrian Mountains of northwest Spain in 2006. The skeletons, which belonged to two men in their early 30s, had been very well preserved in the cool cave.\\nCarbon dating showed the skeletons are around 7, 000 years old, from the time before farming arrived in Europe from the Middle East. Other things were found in the cave, including reindeer teeth that were hung from the people's clothing.\\nThe \\u00a7\\u00a7PROT0\\u00a7\\u00a7 brought some surprises. When Lalueza-Fox looked at it, he found that the man had genes for dark skin. \\\"This guy was darker than any modern European, but we don't know how dark, \\\" the scientist said.\\nAnother surprise was that the man had blue eyes. The results suggest that blue eyes came first in Europe and that the change to lighter skin happened later in Mesolithic times.\\nThis discovery is important for science. It is also important to artists who will have to draw Mesolithic people in a new way. \\\"You see a lot of pictures of these people hunting and gathering and they look like modern Europeans with light skin. You never see a picture of a Mesolithic hunter-gatherer with dark skin and blue eyes, \\\" Lalueza-Fox said.\\nThe Spanish team compared the hunter-gatherer to modern Europeans from different regions to see how they might be related. They found that the ancient \\u00a7\\u00a7PROT0\\u00a7\\u00a7 was most closely related to the \\u00a7\\u00a7PROT1\\u00a7\\u00a7 of people living in northern Europe, in particular Sweden and Finland.\\nnan\\nnan\\nnan\",\n          \"Every morning, before India's capital gets too hot, some old friends meet.

He said that, when you do yoga, you bring together mind and body, thought and action, and create harmony between man and nature. He added that \\\"It is not about exercise - it is about feeling in harmony with yourself, the world and nature\\\".\\nYoga is between 3, 000 and 6, 000 years old. It is connected with local religious traditions including Buddhism and Jainism, as well as Hinduism, which is practised by 80% of Indians. In ancient India, yoga was part of daily life.\\nModi has been criticized for creating a view of Indian culture that doesn't give other traditions a fair place.\\nSuneel Singh, a guru in south Delhi, said that yoga does not just belong to one religion: \\\"Is t'ai chi just Chinese?

            "<TO_ELEM> Noise from ships may disturb animals such as killer whales and dolphins much more than people previously thought. New research shows that underwater noise could disturb the animals' communication and ability to and prey. The low rumble of passing ships has, for a long time, been connected to the disturbance of large whales. But, §§PROT0§§ researchers have also found noise at medium and higher frequencies, including at 20, 000Hz where killer whales, also known as orcas, hear best. These noises could be disturbing the ability of killer whales to communicate and use echo to and their prey. Dolphins and porpoises, which also hear at higher frequencies, may have the same problems. The ndings suggest that the noise could affect the endangered population of killer whales that are found near the shipping lanes up the west coast of the §§PROT0§§. \"The main concern of this is that even a slight increase in sound may make echolocation more dif cult for whales, \" said Scott Veirs, who led the research. Echolocation is the process of using sound to bounce off objects such as prey and identify where they are. \"That's worrying because their prey, chinook salmon, is already quite scarce. Hearing a salmon's click is probably one of the most challenging things a killer whale does. Hearing that subtle click is harder if there's a lot of noise around you.\" The researchers used underwater microphones to measure the noise created by about 1, 600 ships as they passed through Haro Strait, in Washington State, §§PROT0§§. The two-year study recorded the sound made by 12 different types of vessel, including cruise ships, container ships and military vehicles, that passed through the strait about 20 times a day. Some ships are quieter than others but the average intensity of noise next to all the ships was 173 underwater decibels, equivalent to 111 decibels through the air - about the sound of a loud rock concert. Whales are not usually right next to ships and so would hear noise of about 60 to 90 decibels - around the level of a lawnmower or a vacuum cleaner. Veirs said scientists already knew about the impact of underwater noise on large whales. But, the new research shows the threat to smaller whales, dolphins and porpoises. \"Ships have been thought of as low-frequency sources of noise, like the rumbling of lorries or trains, \" he said. \"Most noise is at that low frequency but the background noise of the ocean is raised even in the high frequencies. This could be causing a signi cant problem that we need to look into more.\" There are several further consequences of a noisy underwater environment. Whales may have to group together more closely in order to hear each other. And, if they fail to and prey as effectively, they will need to use up their stores of extra blubber. This is a problem because this blubber often contains manmade pollutants that are toxic to whales if they are released fully into their systems. Veirs said more work needs to be done to identify how badly the noise is affecting whales and also to quieten the ships that pass near them. \"It should be easy to reduce noise pollution, \" he said. \"Military ships are quite a bit quieter and there could be simple ways of transferring that technology to commercial ships. Another way to reduce noise is to slow down. Decreasing speed by six knots could decrease noise by half.\" While some whale species, such as blue whales, the largest mammal on Earth, are safer now because whaling has declined, others are still under threat from a range of factors. The §§PROT0§§ federal government has recently protected nearly 40, 000 square miles of the Atlantic to try to avoid losing a species of whale with just 500 individuals left. In Europe, killer whales are carrying dangerously high levels of banned chemicals in their blubber. Scientists are still trying to and out whether pollutants caused the deaths of ve whales that were found on beaches on the east coast of Britain in January 2016. Meanwhile, around the coast of Australia, whales face an increased threat from ship strikes and oil and gas drilling, as well as Japan's recent decision to start whaling again in Antarctic waters....\n",

Jordan Axani, a 28-year-old Toronto real-estate developer turned charity founder, made it back to Canada with Elizabeth Quinn Gallagher but said the pair had \"forged a brother-sister-like relationship\". Axani had made headlines in 2014 after offering an air ticket to any Canadian named Elizabeth Gallagher. He had booked a three-week vacation with his ex-girlfriend but, after they split up, he was unable to change the name on the flights. That's where Axani's new travelmate, a 23-year-old student from Cole Harbour, Nova Scotia, came in. Gallagher, who goes by the name Quinn, replied to a Reddit post Axani had submitted - along with other hopeful Elizabeth Gallaghers - and was selected. Gallagher had made it clear before the trip that she had a \"pretty serious\" boyfriend but that had not stopped romantics, and journalists, from hoping the globetrotters might fall for one another. Unfortunately, it was not to be. \"I'm going to be explicitly clear, \" Axani said, shortly after the pair returned to Toronto. \"This was never a romantic endeavour. It was strictly platonic. I do not think of Quinn in a romantic light in the least. There is no future for us romantically. She is a good friend. I think of her as a little sister but that will be it. And her feelings are entirely mutual in that regard.\" It took work to establish that brother-sister, good-friend, no-future-for-us-romantically relationship, however. \"It wasn't easy and it certainly wasn't immediate. It took us about a week to really figure each other out, \" Axani said. There was a certain amount of \"natural stumbling\" around \"the dos and don'ts of travelling together\" as the pair got to know each other. \"At the end of it, we'd developed a really great rhythm of, one second, having really funny inside jokes, and, the next second, knowing when the other needed space.\" Although the pair failed to fall for one another, Axani said the trip, which took in Milan, Venice, Vienna, Prague, Khao Lak (in Thailand) and Hong Kong, was \"fantastic\". A favourite place was Prague, Axani said, where they \"had the largest groundswell of people reaching out\". \"Over the course of two and a half days, I think we met about two dozen people. So that's a lot of stories, that's a lot of individuals and that's a lot of love for their home city of Prague.\" People were following the pair on Twitter and Instagram, Axani said, and they were even recognized in the street in Hong Kong. \"It was a real adventure. We had a blast. We learned a lot about ourselves and about each other. I think, coming out of it, I can't imagine it going much better than it did.\" Axani made it back to Toronto at 3am on Monday, 12 January, when the holiday came to an abrupt halt. He went straight into a board meeting with fellow board members at his charity, A Ticket Forward. Axani started the non-profit organization after his Reddit post went viral and intends to offer round-the-world-trips to survivors of abuse, cancer and war. Alongside that, Axani is also in talks to spin his story into a television show or film, although he would not comment on what form those productions might take. \"Suffice to say there's been significant interest from many production companies. We're well advanced.\" In terms of his love life, Axani said he was not looking for his next Elizabeth Gallagher just yet. \"I'm not looking for anything, per se, but life happens and we'll see, \" he said. \"As always, life's a journey.\"...\n",

I just picked it up, \" Louise Haggerty, a 56-year-old hairdresser and waitress, said of her 1am trip to the Black Friday sales. \"It was mental in there. It was crazy. It was absolutely disgusting, disgusting.\" Haggerty had ventured out to the 24-hour Sainsbury's supermarket in Harringay, north-east London with a friend in the hope of snapping up a bargain flat-screen §§PROT0§§. \"But so many people pushed in the queue we didn't have a chance, \" she said. \"The poor woman who was second in the queue was pushed out by a crowd of youths. She didn't get anything. People were behaving like animals - it was horrible, \" she said. \"I only saw two security guards.\" Frustrated with not being able to buy a Blaupunkt 40\" §§PROT0§§ reduced from GBP299.99 to GBP149.99, Haggerty rushed to pick up a Dyson Animal Vac, down from GBP319.99 to GBP159.99. \"I don't even know how much it costs; I don't know even know if I'm going to buy it. I just wanted something, \" she said. \"There are lads in there with three, four, five tellies. It's not fair.\"\" One of those lads was Andy Blackett, 30, an estate agent, who had two trolleys full of bargains. \"I got two coffee makers, two tablets, two TVs and a stereo, \" he said. \"I couldn't tell you the prices but I know they're bargains.\" But his mate Henry Fischer, a 19-year-old student, wasn't as successful. \"Someone snatched my telly from me - it's cos I'm the smaller one.\" Blackett, Fischer and some mates had driven to Sainsbury's at 12.45am after retreating from the \"bedlam\" of Tesco's 24-hour Lea Valley supermarket, where the Black Friday sale started at midnight. \"Tesco was scary so we came here instead, \" Blackett said. More than a dozen police officers attended the Tesco store on Glover Drive, Upper Edmonton, as scuffles broke out between eager and frustrated shoppers. Customers were seen tearing down cardboard hoardings put in place to hold back sale items until the stroke of midnight. Tesco delayed the sale of its most popular sale items - TVs - for almost an hour until police brought the situation under control. One officer was overheard criticizing the manager for failing to ensure adequate security and suggested the sale should be suspended altogether. The Tesco store is across the road from an §§PROT0§§ furniture store that was the scene of riots when it opened with a midnight sale in 2005. Police intervened at other stores, including Tesco in Willesden and Surrey Quays, just before the doors opened at midnight. Greater Manchester Police said at least two people had been arrested at Black Friday sales events already that morning. The force said on its Twitter feed: \"Keep calm, people!\" South Wales Police also reported receiving a number of calls from staff at Tesco stores after they became \"concerned due to the volume of people who had turned up to sale events\". One of the first purchasers of a flat-screen §§PROT0§§, when §§PROT1§§ sales began just before 1am, was James Alled, 30, a businessman, who bought two and was already negotiating to sell one of them to someone further down the queue. \"I bought them for GBP250. I'll sell it to you for GBP350, GBP300 cash, \" he said. Further back in the queue, Christine Ball, 62, wasn't impressed. \"I got here at 10.15pm and I'm further back now than when I got here, \" she said. \"None of that lot know what a queue is.\" Ball, who, like most of the shoppers, had not heard of the §§PROT0§§-inspired Black Friday sales until now, said she had come out especially to buy her grandson a §§PROT1§§ for Christmas. \"Not one of those massive ones; just a normal one at GBP100 or so, \" she said. In her basket was a pint of semi-skimmed and a loaf of bread. \"Telly, milk and bread - the necessities, \" she said. Mel Mehmet, 23, had been to Black Friday sales in 2013 and had expected queues but said the atmosphere in Tesco scared her this time. \"It's crazy, really, having it at midnight - the police must have more important things to do at night than be called to sales. We're going to §§PROT0§§ World first thing - their sale starts at 8am.\"...\n",

            "\"I got a Dyson vacuum cleaner but I don't even know if I want it, \" said 56-year-old Louise Haggerty, as she left the Black Friday sales at one o'clock in the morning. \"It was crazy in there. It was absolutely disgusting, disgusting.\" Haggerty went with a friend to a 24-hour Sainsbury's supermarket in north-east London. She hoped to buy a bargain flat-screen §§PROT0§§. \"But so many people pushed in the queue that we didn't have a chance, \" she said. \"The poor woman who was second in the queue was pushed out by a crowd of youths. She didn't get anything. People were behaving like animals - it was horrible, \" she said. \"I only saw two security guards.\" Haggerty was frustrated when she was unable to buy a §§PROT0§§, which was reduced from GBP299.99 to GBP149.99, so rushed to pick up a vacuum cleaner, which was reduced from GBP319.99 to GBP159.99. \"I don't even know how much it costs. I don't know even know if I'm going to buy it. I just wanted something, \" she said. \"There are young men in there with three, four, five tellies. It's not fair.\" One of those young men was Andy Blackett, who had two trolleys full of bargains. \"I got two coffee makers, two tablets, two TVs and a stereo, \" he said. \"I don't know the prices but I know they're bargains.\" But his friend Henry Fischer wasn't as successful. \"Someone snatched my telly from me - it's because I'm the smaller one.\" More than 12 police officers attended a Tesco store in another part of London because fights started between eager and frustrated shoppers. Tesco delayed the sale of its most popular sale items - TVs - for almost an hour until police brought the situation under control. One police officer said the manager did not provide enough security and suggested the sale should be stopped completely. Police were called to several other stores just before the doors opened at midnight. Manchester Police said they arrested at least two people at Black Friday sales events. South Wales Police also said they received calls from staff at Tesco stores because so many people came to the sales that they became worried. One of the first people to buy a flat-screen §§PROT0§§, when §§PROT1§§ sales began just before 1am, was James Alled. He bought two and was already trying to sell one of them to someone further down the queue. \"I bought them for GBP250 each. I'll sell it to you for GBP350, GBP300 cash, \" he said. Further back in the queue, Christine Ball, 62, wasn't impressed. \"I got here at 10.15pm and I'm further back now than when I got here\" she said. \"These people don't know what a queue is.\" Ball had not heard of the Black Friday sales, which come from the §§PROT0§§, until now. She came out especially to buy her grandson a §§PROT1§§ for Christmas. \"Not one of those massive ones; just a normal one at GBP100 or so, \" she said. Mel Mehmet, 23, went to Black Friday sales in 2013 so she knew there would be queues. But she said the atmosphere in Tesco scared her this time. \"It's crazy to have a sale at midnight - the police have more important things to do at night than come to sales. We're going to §§PROT0§§ World in the morning - their sale starts at 8am.\" nan...\n",

            "Louise Haggerty, 56, a hairdresser, said she went to the Black Friday sale at Sainsbury's in Harringay. She didn't even know if she want it. She just picked it up. \"It was mentally in there,\" she said. \"People were behaving like animals and it was absolutely disgusting, \" she added. Haggerty has ventured out to the 23-hour Sainsbur's supermarket in London with a friend. She wanted to buy a bargain flat- screen §§PROT2§§. But so many people pushed her in the queue that she didn't have a good chance. \"The poor lady who was second in line was pushed out by youths. She did not get anything. There were lads in there - it was horrible. I only saw two guards.\" \"I don't know how much it cost; I don't think I'll buy anything.

Blackett said he, Fischer and some other mates had driven to the Tesco store at 12.15am after retreating from a \"bedlam\" at Tesco's 24 hours Lea Valley supermarket. The Black Friday sales started at midnight. He said: \"Tesco was scared so we came here, \" Blackett told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. More than half a dozen police officers arrived at the TESCO store on Glover Road, Upper Edmonton. Customers were seen ripping down cardboard hoardings that were put in place to keep back sale items until around 1am.

            "<TO_ELEM> Some cities have pigeons. Lima has black vultures or gallinazos. They circle in groups overhead and perch on the city's most emblematic buildings - the decrepit, colonial-era churches and crumbling eighteenth-century piles in the city centre. In many ways, with their wrinkly heads and beady eyes, they remind Lima residents of the side of their city they would rather ignore: the neglect, poverty and filth. But these carrion-eaters' natural affinity for dead and decaying things is being turned into a virtue. Environmental authorities are giving these muchmaligned birds a §§PROT0§§ makeover, kitting them out with GoPro action video cameras and §§PROT1§§ trackers, and giving them a new mission in the fight against fly-tipping and illegal dumping. Samuel is one of the project's ten certified diseasefree Coragyps atratus that have been charged with doing what they do best: sniffing out rubbish. Fitted with his tracker, he is set free above the city, where he identifies clandestine dumps and records the §§PROT0§§ coordinates on a live map. His trainer at Lima's Huachipa Zoo, Alfredo Correa, beams with admiration. \"They can eat dead animals because their metabolism protects them from viruses and bacteria, \" he says. \"They've got some of the strongest gut flora in the natural world.\" The effort is a collaboration between §§PROT0§§ and the Peruvian Environment Ministry to tackle Lima's rubbish problem. Samuel's other airborne companions have been given more evocative names: Capitan Huggin, Capitan Fenix (named after the mythological creature that rises from the ashes) and Capitana Aella (\"Whirlwind\"). A tonguein- cheek video adds a melodramatic voiceover, in which the noble \"carthatidae lineage - the vultures\" are pitted against pestilence and disease, while \"humanity is placidly ignoring the danger\". The project makes a serious point. With just four landfills in a city of nearly ten million inhabitants, there are countless illegal dumps. A fifth of the rubbish ends up there, according to the Environment Ministry. Run-off from the waste contaminates Lima's main water source, the Rimac river, as well as the Chillon and Lurin rivers, which flow into the Bay of Lima. The environmental supervision agency, §§PROT0§§, says that three poorer neighbourhoods, despite having only 12% of Lima's population, have by far the most fly-tipped rubbish: Villa Maria del Triunfo (39.4%), Villa El Salvador (25.3%) and El Agustino (18.3%). The problem, in part, is unpaid taxes. Many residents, especially in the barrios, just don't pay. That means some of the 43 district municipalities lack the resources for basic services such as rubbish collection. It also means nobody is necessarily going to clean up where the vultures identify illegal rubbish. \"We share the vulture's §§PROT0§§ coordinates with the municipalities, \" says Javier Hernandez, the project director. \"It's their job to collect the rubbish and to try and change the habits of their residents.\" The project aims to encourage citizens to be \"vultures on the ground\": to report fly-tipping, cut back on their own waste and recycle. Some residents are responding, posting photos of illicit dumps on the Twitter feed and Facebook page. The idea was hatched at the 2014 United Nations Climate Change Conference, hosted in Lima. \"We were looking for ways to involve not just the authorities but also citizens to generate environmental awareness, \" Hernandez says. Artist Cristina Planas had placed huge, sculpted vulture heads on top of 25 dead palm trees in a wetland reserve in the south of the city. Rich residents hated it as an ugly imposition but Planas invited citizens to \"adopt a vulture\" in support of conservation and recycling. \"We are a little scared of the vulture's appearance, \" she said. \"But in reality, he is out there sacrificing himself for us. He is out there recycling, in the last place we threw out our rubbish.\"...\n",

            "<TO_ELEM> When the Taliban sent a gunman to shoot Malala Yousafzai in October 2012 as she rode home on a bus after school, they made clear their intention: to silence the teenager and kill off her campaign for girls' education. Nine months and countless surgical operations later, she stood up at the United Nations on her 16th birthday on Friday to deliver a defiant riposte. \"They thought that the bullet would silence us. But they failed, \" she said. As 16th birthdays go, it was among the more unusual. Instead of blowing out candles on a cake, Malala sat in one of the main council chambers at the United Nations in the central seat usually reserved for world leaders. She listened quietly as Ban Ki-moon, the §§PROT0§§ secretary-general, described her as \"our hero, our champion\"; and as the former British prime minister and now §§PROT1§§ education envoy, Gordon Brown, uttered what he called \"the words the Taliban never wanted her to hear: happy 16th birthday, Malala\". The event, dubbed Malala Day, was the culmination of an extraordinary four years for the girl from Mingora, in the troubled Swat valley of Pakistan. She was thrust into the public glare after she wrote a blog for the §§PROT0§§ Urdu service describing her experiences struggling to get an education under the rising power of Taliban militants. By 11, she was showing exceptional determination, calling personally on the §§PROT0§§ special representative to Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke, to use his influence to combat the Taliban's drive against education for girls. By 14, she was on the radar of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who put her forward for the International Children's Peace Prize, and, by 15, she became the youngest Nobel Peace Prize nominee in history. But such dizzying global attention came at a price. Death threats followed her growing recognition, and, on 9 October 2012, following a meeting of Pakistani Taliban leaders, the gunman was dispatched to remove what they called the \"symbol of infidels and obscenity\". Multiple operations in Pakistan and the §§PROT0§§ followed the attack on the bus, including the fitting of a titanium plate on her left forehead and a cochlear implant to restore her hearing. She now lives with her family in Birmingham and does what the Taliban tried to stop her doing: goes to school every day. \"I am not against anyone, \" she said in the §§PROT1§§ chamber, having taken this day out from the classroom. \"Neither am I here to speak in terms of personal revenge against the Taliban or any other terrorist group.\" Malala responded to the violence of the Taliban with her own countervailing force: words against bullets. \"I do not even hate the Talib who shot me. Even if there is a gun in my hand and he stands in front of me, I would not shoot him.\" She spoke confidently, with only an injured eye and a slightly drooping left side of her face to hint at such fresh traumas. There was one other unstated allusion to the horror of her past: she wore a white shawl belonging to a woman who was also targeted by extremists but who, unlike Malala, did not survive to tell the tale: Benazir Bhutto, the former prime minister of Pakistan. \"The extremists are afraid of books and pens, \" the teenager continued. \"The power of education frightens them. They are afraid of women. The power of the voice of women frightens them.\" She cited the attack in June on a hospital in Quetta, capital of Baluchistan, and killings of female teachers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. \"That is why they are blasting schools every day - because they were and they are afraid of change, afraid of the equality that we will bring to our society.\" And she gave her own opposing interpretation of Islam to the Taliban's. \"They think that God is a tiny, little conservative being who would send girls to hell just because of going to school. The terrorists are misusing the name of Islam and Pashtun society for their own personal benefits. Islam is a religion of peace, humanity and brotherhood. Islam says that it is not only each child's right to get education, rather it is their duty and responsibility.\" Such ability to articulate what normally remains unarticulated - to give voice to young people normally silenced - has generated its own response. The \"Stand with Malala\" petition, calling for education for the 57 million children around the world who do not go to school, has attracted more than four million signatures - more than a million having been added shortly after Malala's speech. At the start of her speech, Malala said: \"I don't know where to begin my speech. I don't know what people would be expecting me to say.\" She need not have worried....\n",
